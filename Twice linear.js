/*
Description:
Consider a sequence u where u is defined as follows:

The number u(0) = 1 is the first one in u.
For each x in u, then y = 2 * x + 1 and z = 3 * x + 1 must be in u too.
There are no other numbers in u.
Ex: u = [1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 13, 15, 19, 21, 22, 27, ...]

1 gives 3 and 4, then 3 gives 7 and 10, 4 gives 9 and 13, then 7 gives 15 and 22 and so on...

Task:
Given parameter n the function dbl_linear (or dblLinear...) returns the element u(n) of the ordered (with <) sequence u.

Example:
dbl_linear(10) should return 22

Note:
Focus attention on efficiency
*/

function dblLinear(n) {
    let x = 1;
    let y = [];
    let z = [];

     for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        y.push(2 * x + 1);
        z.push(3 * x + 1);
         let min = Math.min(y[0], z[0]);
        if (min === y[0]) x = y.shift();
        if (min === z[0]) x = z.shift();
    }
    return x;
}
